      "I'm happy to help you think this through. Since foot pain has a wide range of possible causes, I'll need a bit more information to offer relevant possibilities. Here are some questions that can narrow it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Location:** Where on your foot is the pain (heel, arch, toes, top, bottom, side)?\n",
      "2. **Onset:** When did the pain start? Was there an injury?\n",
      "3. **Nature:** How would you describe the pain (sharp, dull, burning, throbbing)?\n",
      "4. **Aggravating factors:** Does anything make it worse or better (walking, rest, specific shoes)?\n",
      "5. **Associated symptoms:** Any swelling, redness, bruising, numbness, tingling, wounds, or fever?\n",
      "6. **Medical history:** Any history of diabetes, vascular disease, neuropathy, or recent surgeries?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some common causes of foot pain include:**\n",
      "- Plantar fasciitis (heel/arch pain, worse in morning)\n",
      "- Achilles tendinitis (back of heel)\n",
      "- Stress fracture (localized pain, worsens with activity)\n",
      "- Gout (sudden intense pain, often at the big toe)\n",
      "- Peripheral neuropathy\n",
      "- Mortonâ€™s neuroma (numbness/burning between toes)\n",
      "- Toe deformities (bunions, hammertoes)\n",
      "- Arthritis\n",
      "- Infections or ulcers (especially in immunocompromised or diabetic patients)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Red flags that need prompt evaluation:**\n",
      "- Sudden, severe pain with inability to bear weight\n",
      "- Signs of infection (redness, warmth, pus, fever)\n",
      "- Numbness, weakness, or loss of function\n",
      "- Open wounds, especially in diabetic patients\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to do next?**\n",
      "- If you suspect a fracture, infection, severe injury, or if you have concerning medical history (diabetes, vascular disease), seek medical attention promptly.\n",
      "- For mild pain without alarming features, conservative measures (rest, ice, elevation, over-the-counter pain relief) and proper footwear may help, but persistent or worsening pain still warrants an evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you share a few more details, I can tailor my answer more specifically to your case.\n"
